# Pair Pipeline

Coordinates specialized agents to implement complex, multi-file coding tasks. Uses **iterative discovery with checkpoints** and direct planning.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Add the marketplace from GitHub
/plugin marketplace add GantisStorm/claude-code-repoprompt-codex-plugins

# Install the plugin
/plugin install pair-pipeline@claude-code-repoprompt-codex-plugins
```

## Commands

### command:start - Discovery Loop

Iterative discovery with checkpoints. Best for complex features.

```bash
/pair-pipeline:orchestrate command:start | task:Add user authentication with JWT tokens
/pair-pipeline:orchestrate command:start | task:Fix login button not responding on mobile
/pair-pipeline:orchestrate command:start | task:Add OAuth2 login | research:Google OAuth2 best practices
```

**Flow:** code-scout -> checkpoints -> optional doc-scout -> planning -> execution

**With `research:` provided:** code-scout + doc-scout (parallel) -> checkpoints -> planning -> execution

### command:start-resume - Continue Previous Context

Discovery loop using accumulated context from previous run.

```bash
/pair-pipeline:orchestrate command:start-resume | task:Add password reset flow
/pair-pipeline:orchestrate command:start-resume | task:Add rate limiting | research:Express rate limiting
```

**Flow:** code-scout (if needed) -> checkpoints -> optional doc-scout -> planning -> execution (uses accumulated context)

**With `research:` provided:** code-scout + doc-scout (parallel) -> checkpoints -> planning -> execution

## How It Works

The orchestrator spawns specialized agents via the `Task` tool:

1. **Discovery** - code-scout gathers CODE_CONTEXT; doc-scout adds EXTERNAL_CONTEXT (spawned in parallel when `research:` is provided upfront, otherwise optional at checkpoint)
2. **Checkpoints** - User answers clarifying questions, decides when context is complete
3. **Planning** - planner-start creates implementation plan with per-file instructions
4. **Execution** - plan-coders implement in parallel, verify with code-quality skill

**Flow:** code-scout -> checkpoints -> optional doc-scout -> planner-start (or planner-start-resume) -> plan-coder -> review

## Agents

| Agent | Purpose | Tools | Output |
|-------|---------|-------|--------|
| code-scout | Investigate codebase | Glob, Grep, Read, Bash | Raw CODE_CONTEXT + clarification |
| doc-scout | Fetch external docs | Any research tools | Raw EXTERNAL_CONTEXT + clarification |
| planner-start | Create implementation plan (new task) | Read, Glob, Grep, Bash | file lists + instructions |
| planner-start-resume | Create implementation plan (resume mode) | Read, Glob, Grep, Bash | file lists + instructions |
| plan-coder | Implement single file | Read, Edit, Write, Glob, Grep, Bash | status + verified |

## Tips

**Getting good results:**
- Be specific: "Add logout button that clears session and redirects to /login" not "Add logout"
- For bugs, describe symptoms: "Login button doesn't respond on mobile Safari" not "Login broken"
- Use `research:` for external APIs

**Using command:start-resume:**
- Use `command:start-resume` when adding related features to the same area of code
- The accumulated context (CODE_CONTEXT, EXTERNAL_CONTEXT, Q&A) is preserved
- You can add new research with `command:start-resume | task:... | research:...`

**When things go wrong:**
- BLOCKED status includes error details - read them
- Re-run with `command:start-resume` after fixing blockers
- Incomplete context? Add research at checkpoints

## Comparison with repoprompt-pair-pipeline

| Feature | pair-pipeline | repoprompt-pair-pipeline |
|---------|--------------|--------------------------|
| Discovery | Full loop with checkpoints | Full loop with checkpoints |
| Planning | Direct | Via RepoPrompt MCP |
| Resume | Uses accumulated context | Uses MCP chat_id |
| Dependencies | None | RepoPrompt MCP server |

Use **pair-pipeline** for standalone operation with no external dependencies.

Use **repoprompt-pair-pipeline** when you have RepoPrompt MCP server for planning and context management.

## Requirements

- **Claude Code** - Orchestration, discovery, and execution
